When I ask to setup a new project or install nextjs I want you to run the following instructions sequentially.
First check for the presence of a package.json file (or any file/data for that manner) and do not run this if they are present.
Instead, if there are any files/data present, notify me and confirm with me that I really want to do this.
If I approve, overwrite everything and continue as usual.
If I do not approve, cancel and do nothing.

## Step 1

```bash
pnpm create t3-app@latest .
```

## Step 2

```bash
pnpm i
```

## Step 3

```bash
pnpm dev
```
