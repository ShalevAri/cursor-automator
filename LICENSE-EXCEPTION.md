# License Exception

## Plain English Summary

In simple terms:

- **Permitted Use:** You are allowed to incorporate the rules and scripts contained in this repository (collectively, the “Materials”) into any project—whether open source or proprietary—without forcing your entire project to be licensed under the AGPLv3.
- **Limitation:** This exception applies solely to using the Materials in other projects. If you modify or redistribute the repository itself (the “Core Repository”), those modifications and distributions remain subject to the full terms of the AGPLv3.
